<!--Abstract-->

This paper explores using chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring to improve AI safety by detecting an AI system’s intent to misbehave through its internal reasoning. While imperfect, CoT monitoring shows strong potential, and the authors urge further research and careful consideration of how development choices affect its reliability.
