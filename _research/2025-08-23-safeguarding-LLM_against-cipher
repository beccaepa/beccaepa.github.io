<!--Abstract-->

This paper introduces **CIFR (Cipher Fine-tuning Robustness)**, a benchmark designed to evaluate defenses against adversarial fine-tuning attacks that hide harmful content in encoded data. Using CIFR, the authors show that probe monitors trained on model activations can detect such attacks with over 99% accuracy and generalize well to unseen cipher types, strengthening safety for fine-tuning APIs.
