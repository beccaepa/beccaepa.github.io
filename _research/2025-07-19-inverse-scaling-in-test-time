<!--Abstract-->

This paper investigates how increasing the reasoning length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) can decrease performance, revealing an inverse relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. Across multiple task types, the study identifies several failure modes—such as distraction, overfitting, and amplified problematic behaviors—highlighting the need to evaluate and mitigate these issues when scaling model reasoning.
