A few people have asked to read my personal statement for the Open Philanthropy AI Fellowship after I was awarded the fellowship this year (2020). I’ve released my statement [here](/assets/pdfs/Open-Philanthropy-Statement.pdf). The statement describes my overall agenda and three concrete directions that I have been pursuing towards that agenda.

During the interview (a casual 30 minute chat about my research interests and motivations), I felt that the interviewer was enthusiastic that I had a clear research vision that they felt was (1) exciting from a machine learning perspective and (2) aligned with Open Philanthropy’s mission. Best of luck applying!
