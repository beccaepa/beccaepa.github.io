I am a research scientist at Anthropic working on improving the safety of large language models. I also spend some time at New York University (NYU) collaborating with Sam Bowman's group. 

I received my PhD from NYU under the supervision of Kyunghyun Cho and Douwe Kiela and funded by NSF and Open Philanthropy. Previously, I've spent time at DeepMind, Facebook AI Research, Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, and Google.
